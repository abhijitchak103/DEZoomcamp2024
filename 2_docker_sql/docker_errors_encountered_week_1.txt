Error: docker build Error checking context: 'can't stat '<path-to-file>'
Resolution: This happens due to insufficient permission for docker to access a certain file within the directory which hosts the Dockerfile.
1. You can create a .dockerignore file and add the directory/file which you want Dockerfile to ignore while build.
2. If the above doesnt work, then put the dockerfile and corresponding script, `ingest_data.py` in our case to a subfolder. and run `docker build ...`
from inside the new folder.
